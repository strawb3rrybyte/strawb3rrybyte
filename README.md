🌸 Welcome to my cozy corner of GitHub! 🌸
Hey there! I'm Farah — a curious coder, pixel pusher, snack enthusiast, and professional bug squasher (sometimes I even squash the right ones 😉).
With a background in Food & Nutrition, I bring a fresh perspective to tech — one that blends creativity, empathy, and a love for all things well-designed (and well-plated 🍽️). 
This is my digital playground where I build, break, and occasionally beautify cool things that make life a little tastier and a lot more accessible.

🧁 About Me
🧠 Tech I love: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, MongoDB, and a bit of Python for good measure!

🍪 Outside of code: I’m probably in the kitchen experimenting with new recipes, baking something sweet, or hitting the gym to balance it all out 🏋️‍♀️

🐱 Sidekick: My cat sometimes walks on my keyboard and helps me commit new features.

☕ Fuelled by: Matcha, coffee, and spontaneous inspiration at 2AM.
